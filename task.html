    <h1 class="heading">Java</h1>

    <div class="text">Java is a versatile, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language and computing
        platform, widely used for developing a broad range of applications, from web and mobile apps to enterprise
        software and more. It's known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, meaning compiled Java code can
        execute on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
